# Weather App

This is a simple React application that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather conditions for a given location.

## Features

- User can select a location from a dropdown menu.
- The app fetches and displays the current weather for the selected location, including an icon representing the weather condition (e.g., sun for clear sky, cloud for cloudy, etc).
- If the location is not found or an error occurs during the fetch operation, the app displays an error message.
